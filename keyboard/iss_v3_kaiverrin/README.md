ISS keyboard firmware: Kaiverrin composite
==========================================
DIY keyboard using a Fujitsu Amilo A8830 keyboard (Chicony MP-02686S0-3477, rev 0, lang S/FI) and Synaptics T1006 touchpad.
Middle mouse button is included in the key matrix. Some changes were needed in tmk_core to include the middle button in normal ps2 mouse data.
